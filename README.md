### Hi there 👋

I'm Sergi, I'm a C# developer specilalized in XR. You can usually find me doing stuff on Unity but eventually you will also see me working on C++ or Unreal.

I work at HP doing VR and helping other developers that are willing to join us!

In my free time, I try to diy projects despite they don't always go as planned. My dog 🐶 takes the other part of my free time as we go outdoors to explore nearvy mountains.

I also love to join gamejams but our exploration mindset usually gets on the way of getting something short and concise 😊
